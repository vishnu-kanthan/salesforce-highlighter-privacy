    <h1>Privacy Policy for Salesforce Case Highlighter</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> August 12, 2025</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This privacy policy outlines the data practices for the "Salesforce Case Highlighter" Chrome Extension. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This extension is designed to function entirely on your browser without collecting or transmitting any of your personal data.</p>
    
    <h2>Data We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>We do not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII). This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your name, email address, or user credentials.</li>
        <li>Your Browse history.</li>
        <li>Any data from your Salesforce account or the pages you visit.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data We Use</h2>
    <p>The extension's functionality relies on two types of data that are stored locally on your computer or synced to your own Google account:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User-Configured Settings:</strong> To provide a customized experience, the extension saves your preferred rules and color choices (e.g., breach hours, highlight colors). These settings are saved using the `chrome.storage.sync` API, which syncs them to your personal Google account so your settings are consistent across your browsers. We, the developers, have no access to this data.</li>
        <li><strong>Page Content Interaction:</strong> The extension has permission to read and modify the content of your active Salesforce tab to highlight cases according to your rules. This process is done entirely within your browser and no information about the page content is ever saved or transmitted.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>The extension requires the following permissions to function:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>storage:</strong> To save your custom settings.</li>
        <li><strong>activeTab:</strong> To run the highlighting logic on the current Salesforce page.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy in the future. Any changes will be reflected in the updated extension in the Chrome Web Store.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please contact us through the support section of the extension's Chrome Web Store page.</p>
